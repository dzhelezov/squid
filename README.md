# Subsquid - an ETL framework for Web3 data

[Subsquid](https://subsquid.io/) framework is a set of tools which help
to ingest, transform and present blockchain data.

Our current focus is on [substrate](https://substrate.io) based chains,
with support for ethereum ecosystem coming next.

Subsquid framework consists of several key components:

* [substrate-ingest](substrate-ingest) - responsible for ingestion of blockchain data and 
persisting it in a slightly normalized and decoded form.
* archive - 
* [substrate-processor](substrate-processor)
